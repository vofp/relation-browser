NAME,Smoke
URL,http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/smoke-game-technology-demo/
description,Smoke is a tech demo that showcases a framework to support n-way threading of game technologies. By properly threading a game it can have more accurate physics, smarter AI, more particles, and/or a faster frame-rate. Smoke demonstrates one way to achieve better games.

NAME,Destroy the Castle
URL,http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2007/03/13/download-the-destroy-the-castle-demo-code-from-gdc/
description,This demo shows a highly interactive scene while showcasing methods for threading physics, AI, and particles. This is the binary and source of a demo we created to show how games can take advantage of multi-core processors. Its dead simple - you control a cannon facing down a terrifying, lethal... castle. Knock it down, put it back up and then knock it down again!
